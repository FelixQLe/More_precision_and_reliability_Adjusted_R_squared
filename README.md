### In this repo I will explain the limitations of R-squared, and the importance of Adjusted R-squared in Regession model

R-squared is a statistical measure in regression model, showing how well the model fits a given set of data or how well it will predict a future set of observations (the goodness of fit). 
for example, an R-squared of 100% reveals a model that explains all the variation in the response variable around its mean. Generally, a higher R-squared indicates the better the regression model fits our observations. However, it is not alway the case
- R-squared increases every time we add an independent vairable to the model, 
- R-squared can not determine the coefficent estimates and predcitions are bias, which we have to assess residual plots
